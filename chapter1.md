Chapter 1: Introduction
====================

"Code" is a human-readable way of telling a computer what to do. Most programs consist of taking some form of input and translating it to some form of output. For instance, the web browser takes an input of the site you want to visit and converts it into the display of the page.

I enjoy bridging the physical and digital world (like robotics) and I hope to convey the basic principles in doing that.

Code will look different than the rest of the text ```"like this"```.

Anywhere you see the following syntax ```// it's a code comment the text following it will be ignored by the program```

You should be able to run the code in your node window to play with it. Just open the node program and copy and paste or type the examples.

You can also put the code in a text file with a text editor (I recommend [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.6.2.html) on Windows or [TextMate](https://api.textmate.org/downloads/release) on Mac)

Save the file as ```program_name_here.js``` and run on the terminal with:

```node program_name_here.js```

To run your javascript progam.
