Chapter 1: Introduction
====================

"Code" is a human-readable way of telling a computer what to do. Most programs consist of taking some form of input and translating it to some form of output. For instance, the web browser takes an input of the site you want to visit and converts it into the display of the page.

I enjoy bridging the physical and digital world (like robotics) and I hope to convey the basic principles in doing that.
